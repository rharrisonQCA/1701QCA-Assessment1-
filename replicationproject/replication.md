Temperature Gauge with a Number Range 

https://www.hackster.io/anish78/how-to-create-temperature-gauge-using-micro-bit-a601cc

![Image](replication1.JPG)

This project is related to mine because the code is similar. It is similar because this code obtains the surrounding temperature and moves the servo's horns in the direction of where it's temperature is on the number range. This code will be implemented into the replication project to also obtain the surrounding the temperature, from there the servo will also move between cold, average and hot on a temperature range. Therefore, this project is related to mine because it will use similar code, and provides an output to the user on the temperature.

This project is related to mine because I will end up combining the cups and cupboard roll into my project to make the beeping sound of the alarm louder. As a result of this, the beep sound should be loud enough for a user to hear and take action. In the end, this project is related to mine as it is the best result of my surrounding materials to create a 'Do It Yourself' loud speaker.

Arduino Cooling Pad

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/BuildItDR/arduino-cooling-pad-83335b?ref=search&ref_id=fan%20cooling%20down&offset=0

![Image](fanproject.JPG)

This project is related to mine through its concept of starting the fan to cool down the CPU in a laptop to save the components from overheating. It is related to my replication project by concept by detecting the room temperature and deciding if the lights need to flash and alarm needs to go off for the user to do something about the temperature being too cold or too hot. Whereas, the Cooling Pad sets in motion to quickly cool the laptop down by the click of a button.

![Image](dome.JPG)

This project is related to mine because of its fabrication choice of using duct tape to construction a much larger project such as a dome. It is related to my replication project as it inspired the use of sticky tape to combine all the materials together. In doing so, the tape should keep everything stuck together and keep it compact. In this related project, the use of duct tape was used to connect one bamboo stick to another bamboo stick. While in the replication of the temperature gauge will see the sticky tape connect the breadboard to the roof of the tissue box, the cardboard roll securely to the tissue box and the cold to hot range on the front of the box.

USA National Anthem with Lights & Tone

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Ryaebi/us-national-anthem-with-lights-tone-3ae554?ref=search&ref_id=LED%20flashing&offset=12

![Image](usa.JPG)

This project is related to mine because of its similarities in functions to my replication project. In this USA project, it uses flashing lights to produce an image of the USA flag. At the same time, as these lights light up, the tone of the USA National Anthem plays along side. This function of the USA project is related to my replication project as when the temperature drops or raises above the acceptable temperature threshold, red and yellow lights flash back and forth while a tone of alarm happens. These lights and alarm will stop when the user acknowledges the warning from the project.

$10 Portable Arduino Weather Station

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/GeekRex/10-portable-arduino-weather-station-aws-ccf41f?ref=search&ref_id=temp.%20technology&offset=14

![Image](weatherstation.JPG)

This project is related to mine through the technology it uses to gather the temperature and displays it. In this project, a DHT-22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor is used to gather the room temperature that is then displayed on a LCD screen. The fact that the project uses a component to obtain the temperature, makes it related to my replication project. In my project, a temperature sensor is inbuilt into the micro-bit and will need room to obtain the temperature. At the same time, when this is obtained, it will then be displayed on the LED screen of the micro-bit. The fact that the temperature is being displayed is also related to the Weather Station, as they have a separate LCD screen to display the humidity, temperature, pressure and altitude. 

## Reading reflections ##

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###
Before Don Norman's, The Design of Everyday Things, was read it was believed that the label on doors such as 'pull' or 'push' were just known as labels. But according to this reading, they are known more importantly as "Signifers" which "communicate purpose, structure and operation to user". Also, the belief behind feedback was challenged as I didn't know there could be something considered as 'too much' for feedback. It is mentioned within the reading that a lot of feedback is similar to a "back-seat driver" which is annoying and frustrating. But when there is too much feedback from the product it can be distracting to the user or annoying that it leads to the user to ignore and disable. 

As a result of reading this reading, I now know the extensive length of designing that goes into producing a successful project or machine. These information also leads to knowing that both cognition and emotion must keep mind of these and implement someway into their designs to give the user a successful experience. Before reading Don Norman's work, the concept of 'Affordances' of a product was never know. It was never known that an object gives leeway to another underlying task. For example, a ball affords movement and bounce. 

Although, after the completion of this reading, I am curious to know more about how J. J.Gibson come to his conclusion of how people come to conclusions from "direct perception"  and how it works in regards to the more complicated machinery being built nowadays. From this reading, I would also like to know if previous designers used a similar process to the affordances, signifiers, mapping, feedback and conceptual models process to create a project. With this knowledge, I would like to know if they were implementing any of the listed already before it was labelled as such procedures.  

This reading relates to the replication project of the temperature gauge by ensuring I know the potential human needs, capabilities and behaviours that one might have in regards to my project. While these might be known, I can then develop my project by accomodating for possibile errors a user might make with the project and to user proof the machine to not fall apart. The ideas in the reading will also help to identify the affordances that a temperature gauge can provide, while also leaving signifiers on the box on how to use the machine. This will allow an easier experience of using the project, thus creating an acceptable conceptual model where there will be "major clues of how to operate through percieved structure".

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###
Before reading Dan Saffer's Microinteractions: Designing with Details, I always believed that what is described as microinteractions were carefully constructed features of a device. This was of course challenged by the reading by going in detail about the difference between  a feature and microinteraction. Before reading Dan Saffer's work, I believed that designers created their product and then added the intended features of that product, such as a ringer for a phone, after the completion of the product. However, this was proven correct in his work by stating that the products were made and that, what was found to be microinteractions instead of features, were an added thought after the inital product was finished. 

It was also learnt through this reading that every microinteraction begins with a trigger. Such a trigger could even include just clicking on an application such as emails and leading the microinteraction to display this information. Another trigger could even see that pushing a letter on a keyboard leads to a microinteraction of inputing the letter into the machine to display. Another interesting piece of knowledge discovered from the reading saw that microinteractions are ever growing to keep up with the advanced development of technology. While at the same time, designers are put in a position to come up with lightweight and reduced complexity microinteractions to implement into their machines or technology. 

After the completion of this reading, I would like to know more in depth about what "loops and modes" are in regards to the structure of microinteractions beyond 'meta rules'. This is because just reading 'meta rules' was unclear as to how microinteractions are controlled by this part. 

This piece of reading relates to the project that I am working on by providing information to clearly describe the microinteractions that will occur. For example, majority of the microinteractions within my project are system-initated. These are system-initated to discover the temperature before giving out the feedback through displaying on the LED screen or producing a warning through lights and sound. These rules that occur within consist of if the warning alarm and lights are flashing, the lights will remain flashing until the user presses a button on the micro-bit. These buttons will also act as a trigger for a microinteraction, because if button B is clicked, it will set off the code to discover the temperature in that room. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###
After reading Scott Sullivan's, Protoyping Interactive Objects, the definition of 'designer' has been cemented. This means that my definition of 'designer' being someone who comes up with the ideas, presentation of a product and how actions are going to be taken by this product will be done have proven correctly. Within the reading, Sullivan mentions that a designer "makes nontechnical decisions around the structure, functionality and appearance of a product", which assists with providing my previous definition of design as correct. Also from this reading, the belief behind 'trial and error' has been challenged. The reading has challenged this belief by proving that even if you believe you might of finished or succeeded, there is still a chance that it might not work or reach the desired outcome. This was proven through Sullivan's Capybara casestudy where after a couple of weeks of beta testing they began to move on to the next stage. That was until they discovered that the sensors were not accurately counting up the people within the store, as one of the sensors counted one person walking back and forth numerous times. This error led to find another sensor to trial and see if it would be a better solution to the error. 

After reading Sullivan's work, it was learnt that regardless of everything going fine, you can still find barriers or obstacles that will be needed to be overcome. As a result of this, trial and error becomes a frequently tool to use when creating code or testing the project. Another piece of knowledge learnt from this reading sees sketching as a design coding that supports proof of a concept and how a project might come together. 

When finished this reading, I would like to know more on the topic of if Capybara was issued to any other stores to see if the technology used in Tigertree was still accurate in counting people elsewhere. This information would be good to know as it would ensure that the final chosen parts of the project are the best chosen components to gain the accurate information. 

This reading relates to the replication project I am currently working on as trial and error has become a massive part in trying to get the temperature gauge to operate appropriately. It also teaches that if a piece of technology or component does not work, to try something else, as well as to not give up easily. These connections come from Scott Sullivan's own experiences with Capybara project.
