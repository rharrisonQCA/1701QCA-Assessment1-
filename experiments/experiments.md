### LED Flash and Beep ###

This experiment consisted of creating from scratch a LED that began on start up to be on for 3 seconds before flashing every second after. The experiment also wanted to produce a sound every time the LED was turned off.

In this experiment, something new to me was having to complete the micro-bit code and required wires onto the breadboard without following instructions. This meant that I could finally discover the purpose of where and why a mother-father wire is connected between the breadboard and edge connector breakout board. I was unable to truly discover the meaning behind this before as I rushed through the tutorial book's experiments without putting much thought into why these wires and parts were going where they were as I just followed the given instructions. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as the pedestrian crossing around Australia. Obviously, its not the same as the experiment, but the pedestrian crossing is an improved upon verison of this experiment. For example, when the LED person is red a low sounding beep occurs in intervals of at least 2 seconds. Then when that LED turns green, a higher pitch beeping sound pounds one after another, signaling it is safe to cross the road. 

### Dimming an LED using a Potentiometer ###

The experiment determines whether or not a LED needs to have power based on if a user has pushed the button connected to the micro-bit. From there, the user can adjust the brightness of this LED by turning the potentiometer to be bright or dimmer. At the end, the button can also turn the power to the LED off.

In this experiment, a push switch and potentiometer were used for the first time since obtaining the micro-bit kit and these parts purpose were learnt. I also learnt through this experiment what the difference between an 'analog write pin' and 'digital write pin' is through following the instructions. I also did further testing by trying out both pins to see if the difference actually mattered. As a result of this, it turned out that it did matter, because when the 'digital write pin' replaced the 'analog write pin' nothing happened when the button was pressed. This also led to researching why and it was discovered that an analog write ranges from 0 to 255, whereas a digital write is only either high or low. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a dimmer light that are inbuilt into houses. The mechanics work similiarly, just that the experiment made with the micro-bit is a mini verison of the application built into houses. This dimmer light in the real world as an application sees a user choose to turn the light switch on and can adjust the voltage sent to the inbuilt light. This voltage would be sent through the wires in the wall to reach the light.
